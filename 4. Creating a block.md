Creating a Block
==========================

### Overview
A Block is a segment of HTML that is controlled by a Document Type that is linked to a Controller or Partial View. The document type is used to create a Content node in Umbraco that is used as the Model for the Block.  The Model is represented by an instance of IPublishedContent.  As a side note, you also have access to the current block in both types of blocks.

Traditionally in Umbraco you would render a HTML segment by calling the HtmlHelper extension Partial or Action methods.  This is basically what Web Blocks does for you internally.  Essentially, Web Blocks allows Content Editors to order these calls - that's all.

    //render by calling a Controller Action
	@Html.Action("Render", "ContactForm")
	
	//render by calling a Partial View
	@Html.Partial("FeatureBlock")

When Web Blocks renders your block, the outer element will be rendered for you, which is a *div* by default.  You have control over the element type, css classes and all other attributes via properties on the inherited Controller or Partial View Template.  We will explain how to do this for each below.

## How to create a Controller Block
A Controller Block's class name must be the name of the Document Type's alias.  When Web Blocks finds a Controller matching this naming convention, it will target the Render action on the controller.

### Example
In this example, we will show you how to create a Video Block, which will simply render a Video Player which will play a video that was set on the Block Content Node.

	public class VideoBlockController : WebBlockController
    {
        public ActionResult Render()
        {
            BlockElementClasses.Add("VideoBlock");

            VideoBlockViewModel model = new VideoBlockViewModel(CurrentBlock);            

            return PartialView("Blocks/VideoBlock", model);
        }
    }
The code above does the following:

1. Adds a "VideoBlock" css class to the outer element
2. Creates the view model by passing in the Current Block (IPublishedContent)
3. Returns the Partial View to render and passes in the View Model to render
